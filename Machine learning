I have done analysis in Google Collab for the machine learning part.

I took the data from different patients and hospitals. The dataset contains ECG values like Amplitude,RR and speed.
 
First i split my data in such a way that 80% of it constitutes the Training data and 20%, the test data.
 
Here i have used supervised learning. It has two types: regression and classification. 
 
As i need to predict three diseases  which are venticular arrhythmias, tachycardia, bradcardia,so  we have taken 4 output variables .
 
I have used regression technique because output variables are more than 2 .
 
I tested the data sets with all regression techniques like Linear regression,lasso regression,Ridge,KNN,SVM, Random Forest and decision Tree.
 
By using Hyper Parameter tuning, we can find the best parameters to the model andconsequently, the best accuracy. 

Here i have used hyper parameter using gridsearchCV and Randomizedsearch . Based on the time complexity i have choosed whether to use grid or randomized.

KNNâ€™s accuracy using the technique comes out to be around 84.7% which is the best compare to all techniques.

The parameters obtained were: areleaf_size = 1, n_neighbors = 2, p = 1.

So then i have deployed the KNN model in flask.
 
For deploying the KNN model  i have used Flask. Flask is used to deploy ML models, flask is nothing but a framework.
